== Introduction

Fife and Drum are two RISC-V CPUs coded in the BSV High-Level Hardware
Design Language (HLHDL).  Please see link:../README.html[README] for
general information about the CPUs and the accompanying textbook that
describes the source code and BSV in detail.

This document focuses on how to build and run the code:

* How to compile the BSV source code to Verilog
* How to run the generated Verilog in a Verilog simulator

// ****************************************************************

== Fife and Drum source files brief overview

NOTE: All the code is discussed in detail in the accompanying textbook.

Directory `src_Common/` contains code shared by Drum and Fife:

* `Arch.bsv` parameterizes the code for RV32 or RV64. At the moment we
  only support RV32.
* `Instr_Bits.bsv` defines instruction coding/decoding.
* `CSR_Bits.bsv` defines CSR (Control-and-Status Register) coding/decoding.
* `RISCV_GPRs.bsv` describes module(s) for general-purpose registers.
  It contains two module implementations, with and without bypassing.
* `CSRs.bsv` describes module(s) for CSRs.
* `Mem_Req_Rsp.bsv` defines requests and responses to memory.
* `IALU.bsv` is generic Integer and Arithmetic ops ALU.
* `Fn_*.bsv` define functionality of each step (fetch, decode, ...).
* `Inter_Stage.bsv` describes data communicated betweens steps/stages.
* `CPU_IFC.bsv` describes the CPU interface.

Directory `src_Fife/` contains Fife-specific source code.  It contains
pipeline stages, a simple branch-predictor, epoch-management for
mispredictions, a scoreboard to manage pipeline register read/write
hazards, and a store-buffer for speculative memory ops.  Specifically,
the pipeline stages are in the files `S1_F.bsv`, `S2_D.bsv`,
`S3_RR.bsv`, ..., and the file `CPU.bsv` integrates them into a
pipeline.

Directory `src_Drum` contains the Drum-specific source code. The
single file `CPU_FSM.bsv` contains a state-machine that sequences
through each instruction's steps, using BSV's `StmtFSM` facility.
`CPU_rules.bsv` (Warning: may not be up to date) is a manual
transcription of `CPU_FSM.bsv` using BSV rules instead of `StmtFSM`

Directory `../src_Top/` contains a common "top-level" (in `Top.bsv`)
that instantiates one of the CPUs, instantiates a memory-and-MMIO
subsystem, and connects them (instruction-fetch channel, speculative
memory data channel and non-speculative MMIO channel).  The
memory-and-MMIO system is implemented mostly in C code (not BSV), in
`C_Mems_Devices.c` and `UART_model.c`.

== Prerequisites and one-time steps

Install some free and open-source tools, in particular the _bsc_
compiler (BSV-to-Verilog) and the Verilator compiler
(Verilog-to-simulator).  This link:Platform_Setup_Guide.html[Platform
Setup Guide] provides guidance.

[NOTE]
====

*PLEASE SKIP THIS ONE-TIME STEP FOR NOW.  It populates the
`bluespec_BSV_Additional_Libs/` directory, but its external Git repo
is not yet public, so we have already performed this step and included
the results in the tar file distribution.*

Do this in the `vendor` directory:
----
$ cd vendor
$ make all
----

This will use the Python program `Tools/vendor.py` to make local
copies of files needed from other external repositories (i.e., git
clones them and makes local copies of selected files).  The
specification of remote repositories and which files to copy is found
in files named `*.vendor.hjson`.

This creates and populates directory `bluespec_BSV_Additional_Libs/`.

In case you get a Python error like `ModuleNotFoundError: No module
named 'hjson'`, please perform this Python package installation:
----
$ pip install hjson
----

_Acknowledgement:_ `vendor.py` is from OpenHWGroup's open-source
repository at
`https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6/blob/master/util/vendor.py`.

== How to compile (generate Verilog from BSV source code), link and simulate

Change into either of the following directories:

----
$ cd Build/Drum
$ cd Build/Fife
----

// ================================================================
=== Compile

----
$ make v_compile
----

This invokes the _bsc_ compiler to compile BSV source codes into
Verilog files in the `verilog/` directory.

* `mkTop.v` is the top-level Verilog module for the full system.
* `mkCPU.v` is the top-level CPU module (instantiated inside `mkTop.v`)

It will also copy some Verilog files from your _bsc_ installation into
`verilog/`, so that `verilog/` is self-contained.

[NOTE]
====
* `make clean` removes intermediate files and directories
* `make full_clean` also removes the `verilog/` directory, log files, etc.
====

// ================================================================
=== Link

Here we describe building and running a Verilator simulation
executable.  (See section below on using alternative simulators,
synthesizing for FPGA etc.)  In either the `Build/Drum/` or
`Build/Fife/` directories:

----
$ make v_link
----

This invokes the Verilator tool and builds a simulation executable,
`exe_Drum_RV32_Verilator` and `exe_Fife_RV32_Verilator`, respectively.

// ================================================================
=== Simulate

----
$ make v_run
----

This runs the executable, which first loads a file `test.memhex32` for
the initial contents of RISC-V memory, and then runs the loaded RISC-V
program.

Normally, execution never stops: please type `^C` to halt the
simulation.

Special case for the standard RISC-V ISA tests such as `rv32ui-p-add`
(described in the next section): these tests write a SUCCESS/FAIL code
to a memory location called `tohost`.  The simulator is set up to exit
automatically when this happens (this is useful for scripting to run
all ISA tests).

The `Build/Drum` and `Build/Fife` directories have symbolic links from
`test.memhex32` to
`Tools/Hello_World_Example_Code/hello.RV32.bare.memhex32` so it can be
run out-of-the-box.  Please replace `test.memhex32` to run other
RISC-V programs.

When invoking the simulation executable, if you provide the
command-line argument `+log`, then it will also write out a log file
`log.txt` with detailed instruction-by-instruction information.

WARNING: `log.txt` can be large, depending on how long you run the simulation.

// ================================================================
=== The `test.memhex32` file (initial contents of RISC-V memory)

A `.memhex32` file is a Verilog hex memory file where each entry
represents a 32-bit word (i.e., addresses increment by 4 from one
entry to the next).

For Drum and Fife the file should contain RV32I RISC_V code starting
at address `0x8000_0000`.

The directory `Tools/Hello_World_Example_Code/` contains one such
code, for the classical C "Hello World!" program:

* `hello.c`: Programs source code

* `hello.RV32.bare.elf`, `hello.RV32.bare.map` and
  `hello.RV32.bare.objdump`: these are standard outputs from running
  `hello.c` through the RISC-V _gcc_ C compiler and linking it with
  some startup code (not included here).

* `hello.RV32.bare.memhex32`: this is the output of running
  `hello.RV32.bare.elf` through the
  `Tools/Elf_to_Memhex32/Elf_to_Memhex32.c` tool.

The `Build/Drum` and `Build/Fife` directories have symbolic links from
`test.memhex32` to `hello.RV32.bare.memhex32` so it can be run
out-of-the-box.

The directory `Tools/Hello_World_Example_Code/` contains an example
code, for the classical C "Hello World!" program:

* `hello.c`: Programs source code

* `hello.RV32.bare.elf`, `hello.RV32.bare.map` and
  `hello.RV32.bare.objdump`: these are standard outputs from running
  `hello.c` through the RISC-V _gcc_ C compiler and linking it with
  some startup code (not included here).

* `hello.RV32.bare.memhex32`: this is the output of running
  `hello.RV32.bare.elf` through the
  `Tools/Elf_to_Memhex32/Elf_to_Memhex32.c` tool and is
  the file loaded by Drum and Fife simulation into RISC-V memory.

A second example is in directory `Tools/rv32ui-p-add_Example_Code/`:

* The source code is from the repository for standard RISC-V ISA
  tests: `https://github.com/riscv-software-src/riscv-tests`.
  Specifically this is the `rv32ui/add.S` test.

* `rv32ui-p-add` is the ELF file produced by compiling the test with
  `riscv-gcc` for architecture RV32I, and then linking it with a
  startup script (not provided here).  `rv32ui-p-add.dump` is the
  associated objdump file, also produced by `riscv-gcc`.

* `rv32ui-p-add.memhex32` is the output of running the ELF file
  through the `Tools/Elf_to_Memhex32/Elf_to_Memhex32.c` tool, and is
  the file loaded by Drum and Fife simulation into RISC-V memory.

// ================================================================
=== Example transcripts of build (compile-link-run)

In case you run into into issues, the files
`Build/{Drum,Fife}/transcript_build.txt` show transcripts of expected
terminal output during compile, link and run.

// ================================================================
=== Experimental pipeline visualizer

WARNING: This tool is still being developed and is likely to be flaky.

In `Build/Drum` and `Build/Fife` the following command:

----
$ make show
----

uses the Python tool in `Tools/Log_to_CSV` to process `log.txt` into
`log.txt.csv` which is a standard "Comma-Separated Values" file
recognized by most spreadsheet programs such as Microsoft Excel, Apple
Numbers and OpenOffice Calc.  When loaded into the spreadsheet
program, it will show a visualization of the pipeline.  The vertical
axis represents sequential instruction numbers (including
mispredictions), and the horizontal axis represents time (clock
ticks).

The following is screenshot of the display for the first 16
instructions of "Hello World!":

image::IMG_Pipeline_Viz_Hello.png[align="center", width=1000]

Reading each line from left-to-right we can see the steps/stages for
each instrution (Fetch, Decode, RegisterRead, EXecute, Retire,
Writeback, ...) at each clock tick.

The "RR.S" annotations indicate pipeline stalls during register-reads
due to register read/write hazards managed by the scoreboard.

The "Fredir" at the end of instruction 15 (BNE) shows a redirection of
the Fetch unit due to the Branch being taken.  The "RET.discard" at
the end of instruction 16 (JAL) shows it being discarded due to
misprediction (fall-through from BNE when BNE was taken).

// ****************************************************************
== Alternative Simulators and Synthesis for FPGA

There are other options to build-and-run but we do not describe them here.

* The Verilog produced by `make compile` in the
`Build/{Drum,Fife}/verilog/` directories can be run in any Verilog
simulator, such as Icarus Verilog (iverilog), commercial simulators
from Xilinx/Synopsys/Siemens/Cadence, etc.
+
You will have to instantiate `mkTop.v` and provide it with a clock
and a reset signal.
+
The generated Verilog uses `import "DPI-C"` to link-in the C files
`src_Top/C_Mems_Devices.c` and `UART_model.c`
+
`mkTop.v` merely instantiates `mkCPU.v` and connects it to the
`C_Mems_Devices.c` You can replace `mkTop.v` to instantiate
`mkCPU.v` and connect it to your own memory system.

* The _bsc_ compiler can generate a standalone ("Bluesim") simulation
  executable (no need for a Verilog simulator).
+
Doing `make b_compile b_link b_run` (instead of `v_compile v_link
v_run`) will create a Bluesim simulation executable instead of a
Verilator simulation executable, and run it.
+
Please see the _bsc_ User Guide for details about this build flow.

* The Verilog produced by `make compile` in the `verilog/` directory
  is ready for processing through FPGA or ASIC synthesis tools.  You
  will have to instantiate `mkCPU.v` and connect it to your memory
  system, devices etc.
